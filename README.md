👋 Hey there! I'm César, made the  transition from Business Intelligence to the Development career. Currently, I'm fully immersed in the .Net environment, working on diverse projects to sharpen my coding skills.

💼 Right now, my focus lies in developing robust applications using .Net technologies. From web applications to desktop tools, I'm exploring the endless possibilities within this ecosystem.

🚀 I'm committed to leveling up my coding skills, and you'll find my GitHub gradually filling up with .Net projects showcasing my progress.

🤝 Let's collaborate and code together, one line at a time! Connect with me on LinkedIn: www.linkedin.com/in/cespirandelli/
