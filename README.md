👋 Hey there! I'm César, and I'm diving headfirst into the exciting world of software development. 
Some while ago, I switched gears from the Business Intelligence to the Development Career, and I've been on a thrilling learning curve ever since.

💼 Right now, I'm working on all sorts of projects, tinkering with mostly with .Net Environment. 

🚀 I'm on a mission to level up my coding skills, and you'll see my GitHub slowly filling up with stuff I'm working on. 

📊 In addition to my work, I'm got my second degree at FIAP, Data Science, Big Data & Business Intelligence. 

🤝 One line of code at a time. 
Let's connect, collaborate, and code together!
