👋 Hey there! I'm César, and I'm diving headfirst into the exciting world of software development. 
About three months ago, I switched gears from the Business Intelligence Team to the Development Team at my company, and I've been on a thrilling learning curve ever since.

💼 Right now, I'm working on all sorts of projects, tinkering with tech like React, Node.js, and Django. 
I've got some experience with Python and SQL, but I wouldn't say I'm a master of either just yet.

🚀 I'm on a mission to level up my coding skills, and you'll see my GitHub slowly filling up with stuff I'm working on. 
It's all part of my journey to learn fast and learn well.

🤝 Join me on this coding adventure as I figure things out, one line of code at a time. 
Let's connect, collaborate, and code together!
